Actually, I think all web developers should die. I changed domain registrars yesterday and was reminded of webdev-as-a-vocation. What does a blog need to track you for? How many elements does a blog need to load before you can read it? What is "subscribe to my newsletter"? 

I graduated not long ago, so I have more time to devote to creaturely pursuits (i.e this website and the creative expressions it purports to house). Before this all began&mdash;going to school and spending another 2 years drunk, mainly in the company of others, as opposed to drunk, exclusively alone&mdash;I had come up with two separate ideas for vast, operatic stories. One was set in the year 1976 on Earth and the other took place across 3 planets and a roaming starship. They contrasted the domestic-flavored jazz I default to writing but in the sense that the old material was a subset of the new: the chronological scale remained a fraction of any human lifespan, and the beating heart of the stories was itself human, with all the intimacy that affords. Regardless, there is a marked difference between documenting one or two lives in the final days of an empire and whatever it was I was doing, even if the empire still fell by the end.

Those projects are both dashed and the characters themselves so entrenched in their worldbuilding that separating any of them from the context in which they were designed seems impossible. I won't try very hard to, either, but enough material has survived that some of it will inevitably end up here. After all, I have recurring fixations, and a perk of writing a very long story is that every emotion a person could feel appears at some point. 

Part of me feels that this is the first and last real story I'll ever put together.

Still hate JavaScript so this website still doesn't use any on the client side.
