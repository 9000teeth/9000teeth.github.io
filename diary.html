	<h1>7 aug 2022</h1>
	<p>I showed him the video of Lang Lang, who he finds tedious, <a href="https://youtu.be/fyJemf8hwkU">performing with his father</a>, and he told me that his own brother had owned an erhu once. They cost two yuan, a thirtieth of his family’s monthly income. They were easy to produce (one side snakeskin / one side open) and sounded, most critically, sad, and so were an instrument associated broadly with beggars and buskers. Like Irish pennywhistles.</p>
	<p>We share a conversation every time we’re in the car, but it is always what he tells me about the country only a decade and a half old when he knew it that I enjoy most. An unvarnished, journalistic feeling to the way he speaks. When we went to the park on Thursday, he talked about dragonflies / powderflies / how kids would eat milkweed, proclaiming it nourishing. I replied with how the kids I grew up with split dandelion stems, drank the milk for bravery.</p>
	<p>I do not want to tell him this: I feel that he’ll die before I graduate college. Suddenly. Not an accident. If he falls terminally ill, I’ll buy a notebook with a cover design he’ll like (cats / sunflowers / powderflies) from the Japanese stationary store we visit on trips south. I’ll ask him to recount as much of his life as he can tolerate. The childhoods especially, springtime portended by red dragonflies;</p>
	<p>then he’ll keep talking. Not about his childhoods. About, maybe, why Tianjin is the worst-designed city in the world, but how yuxiang meat is as popular there as burgers in America; how unclean the streets are, how solid and oppressive the humid summer heat, but how commuters ate lamian served from an enormous pot into bowls that they held squatting in the grass. Or about war: Foreign soldiers made corpse-piles in times of siege, in every public grave a corpse-pile,</p>
	<p>starvation so rampant that for every seven men withered to death there was one who gorged himself on weeds until his stomach ruptured; how after months of starvation, somebody opened a bao shop, and the question nobody asked was, <i>Where is the meat coming from?</i>, but...</p>
	<p>There’s no second half after the “but”. What I mean is that he’ll talk about this and that and I’ll be listening so intently that I’ll close the notebook, promising to fill in the rest from memory later. Later&mdash;I’ll get too busy to visit his hospital room.</p>
	<p>Is it appropriate to say <i>I don’t remember how this was supposed to end</i> if it won’t even happen?</p>

	<p>Post-work exploration cut short by tornado sirens. There is nothing I could say about this noise that couldn’t also be said about every other noise in the world. The heat won’t let up, but I’ve got an oscillating fan.</p>

	<p>Moved. Elsewhere. Across my building is a Korean barbecue restaurant with another apartment of sorts on the second floor. As late as eleven o’clock&mdash;and, I guess, even later&mdash;I see someone sitting or walking there, curtains open, a yellowish light on.</p>
	<p>Every weekday from late morning to early evening, a trumpeter plays in front of the community center. Same days, same time, at the Wentworth intersection, a man sings with a karaoke machine on which he has taped a note reading “thank you for your support” in two languages. Maybe it is just my imagination, but I get the impression that every day these two performers move closer and closer to each other. This might end violently.</p>
	<p>A lot of people smoke behind the dumpsters here, a lot of men. Everyone is so beautiful.</p>

	<div>
	<h1>1 jan 2022</h1>
	<p>Back home for a day and a night and part of a day. Not moving, just passing through. Most of my belongings are still in the car. Chicago is snowless, and here the blizzard has so thickened that you can really only feel either comforted or hopeless.</p>
	<p>I began thinking up obituaries for myself.</p>
	<p>Mom was happy to see me. I was sleeping in my childhood bed in my childhood bedroom, which seemed smaller than ever.</p>
	<p>I woke up but I didn’t move. Someone stopped in the doorway&mdash;I thought it was my mom. It was my dad, and he sighed very quietly and left. I can only tell you this with any certainty because he used to do this all the time, if you could believe me.</p>
	<p>When I finally got out of bed, I thought it was morning, but I went to the kitchen and saw that it was ten past one in the afternoon.</p>

	<p>Took the train to get Thai food, but the train was over 15 minutes delayed. I enjoyed a one-two-goodbye exchange with a commuter waiting for the same train. A group of students wearing Halloween costumes swayed, nudged each other, swayed on the opposite platform. Somebody was dressed as Zelda.</p>
	<p>I forgot how sweet some Thai food can be. What a nice surprise! The bookstore next door was closed for the night.</p>

	<p>I haven’t drunk much water in a while. I feel bloated and absurd almost all the time.</p>
	<p>I need to buy baking soda tomorrow. Perhaps other vegetables.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h1>6 sep 2021</h1>
	<p>Not much to say at the moment. It’s still unseasonably hot outside. I can’t tell if this is optimism or not. I’m glad you’re here.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h1>12 aug 2021</h1>
	<p>The light is blue and early. In the dark, I saw the sloping curve of a forearm.</p>
	<p>It was my forearm. Mine! This very simple fact made me feel cheated somehow, and I walked about twenty times to the kitchen and back with a satanic throbbing beneath my eyelids.</p>
